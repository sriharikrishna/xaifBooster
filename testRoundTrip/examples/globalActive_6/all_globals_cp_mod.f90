! General Information:
! xaifBooster is intended for the transformation of 
! numerical programs represented as xml files according 
! to the XAIF schema. It is part of the OpenAD framework. 
! The main application is automatic 
! differentiation, i.e. the generation of code for 
! the computation of derivatives. 
! The following people are the principal authors of the 
! current version: 
! 	Uwe Naumann
!	Jean Utke
! Additional contributors are:
