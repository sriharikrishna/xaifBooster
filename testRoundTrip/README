we expect the rest of the system be build
including Open64/OpenAnalysis/whirl2xaif etc. 

and the following environment variables: 

RICETOOLROOT    as set in ./setenv.sh

XAIFBOOSTERROOT as set in ../setenv.sh

XAIFSCHEMAROOT  as set in <xaif_repository>/setenv.sh

We assume the test code to be named 

testCode.f
